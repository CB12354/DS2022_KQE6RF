- Hobbies: Digital art, video games, creative writing
- Spyname: Verily Norman, P.I.
- About me: I have no name, but the media calls me Verily Norman. I live in the shadows with many names, none too permanent. The job is the only thing that matters: get in, get the information, and get out. I was never there. They've never found me.
